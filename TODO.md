### Features and Improvements

* Allow arbitrary views in a page spread (the URL-fetched image view would be an included subspec)
* Better animation of the switch to/from single page mode.
* Arbitrary overlay views (decouple hotspots from the pagedView)
* Fetching and error views (a property of the singlePageContents view)
* Allow for an arbitrary view to appear after the last page
* Don't fetch/prefetch images for pages when animating to a new page.
* Animate image appearance
* Documentation & Cleanup
* Prioritise image fetching


### Known Issues

* When on last page switching from Two page to single page means you scroll to a random page
